## Game of Life

### Another one?

I wanted to use this project to achieve a certain set of goals:

1. Learn more about graphics programming. I could've chosen [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) which already has a Game of Life plugin, but then I wouldn't learn as much as I would doing it from scratch with [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)
2. Use this as a witness to my knowledge. I can say "I know Rust" or "I know graphics programming" all I want, but nothing will really say how good or bad I really am at it better than my own work
3. Make it very good

### General Goals

- To make it FAST yet not dealing with headaches of debugging memory issues
- To make it run lean on memory. I want to at least get close to the point where all the memory I am using is all the memory the program would absolutely need
- To make it fancy. The objective is to have it be very customizable and easy to use

Hence Rust and [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu)

### Wait, but this is not complete...

You are seeing this despite it is not completed because I want you to see what I can do despite it is in progress.
Why am I showcasing it if it is still in progress? Because I really want to showcase it, but I don't see myself finishing it soon because

- This takes time and that is something that I would really appreciate right now. With 3 AP exams incoming and me wanting to get 5s in all of them, with classes in which I find it is unacceptable to not do my best in, with other personal things going on, the time that I have to work on this is less than what I would need to finish it within the window I would desirably want to finish it in

### Working On

- Getting the squares to draw nicely with the corner radius
