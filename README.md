## Game of Life

### Another one?

I wanted to use this project to achieve a certain set of goals:

1. Learn more about graphics programming. I could've chosen Bevy which already has a Game of Life plugin, but then I wouldn't learn as much as I would doing it from scratch with wgpu
2. Use this as a witness to my knowledge. I can say "I know Rust" or "I know graphics programming" all I want, but nothing will really say how good or bad I really am at it better than my own work
3. Make it very good

### Goals

- To make it FAST yet not dealing with headaches of debugging memory issues
- To make it run lean on memory. I want to at least get close to the point where all the memory I am using is all the memory the program would absolutely need
- To make it fancy. The objective is to have it be very customizable and easy to use

Hence Rust and wgpu

### Wait, but this is not complete...
